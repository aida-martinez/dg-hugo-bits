Martin Scorsese and Christopher Lee are very good friends, but up until 2010 had never worked together. Lee's response when he was asked by Scorsese to appear in Hugo was: "It's about time!"

The opening track shot of the city ending at the train station was the very first shot designed and it took one year to complete. It required 1000 computers to render each frame required for the shot.

The guitarist, who appears early in the film and also at the Georges Méliès party near the end, is modeled after famed Belgian guitarist Django Reinhardt. The filmmakers even went so far as to have the actor's left hand match Django's: that is, he doesn't use his fourth and fifth fingers (they were burned in a fire).

In flashbacks we see Georges Méliès staging his productions with lavishly colored sets and costumes. The real Méliès only used sets, costumes and make-up in grayscale, since colored elements might turn out the wrong shade of gray on black and white film. Many of the prints were then hand tinted in post-production.

The cam mechanism in the automaton is heavily inspired by the machinery in the Jaquet-Droz automata, built between 1768 and 1774. Indeed these automata are still in working condition (they can be seen at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuchâtel, in Switzerland) and are capable of drawing figures as complicated as the drawing depicted in the film. Many nuances such as the head following the pen as it was drawing and dipping the pen in ink were also present in the automata in real life.

The music during the scene in which Hugo and Isabelle read in the book The Invention of Dreams about the history of film making is Danse Macabre by Camille Saint-Saëns. He is considered to be the first composer ever to write an official movie soundtrack for L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), making this musical reference quite apt.
