## Quotes from the movie (not the SSG)

__Hugo Cabret__: I'd imagine the whole world was one big machine. Machines never come with any extra parts, you know. They always come with the exact amount they need. So I figured, if the entire world was one big machine, I couldn't be an extra part. I had to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason, too.

__Hugo Cabret__: Maybe that's why a broken machine always makes me a little sad, because it isn't able to do what it was meant to do... Maybe it's the same with people. If you lose your purpose... it's like you're broken.

__Georges Méliès__: If you've ever wondered where your dreams come from, you look around... this is where they're made.

__Isabelle__: We could get into trouble.
__Hugo Cabret__: That's how you know it's an adventure.

__Georges Méliès__: My life has taught me one lesson, Hugo Cabret, and not the one I thought it would. Happy endings only happen in the movies.
